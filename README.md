# GMath

This project is a library with the most common objects and functions in computer graphics and some of the computational geometry. The library is not parallel powered like numpy or torch and only offers the basic tools for algorithms. Most intended for computer graphics proofs of concepts like renderers techniques, spatial data-structures, etc. It is not intended to be fast but accurate and explicit clean and well explained code.

There is a set of most used shader functions and types. Also, contains tools functions like distances, intersection tests, area calculators.
